# clustering
A collection of clustering algorithms optimized for the modern hardware. Part of ongoing research at DASlab (daslab.seas.harvard.edu) at Harvard.
This part contains K-means and K-means++ implementations.
Just go to the main function located in test.cc and comment and uncomment the methods correspoding to the implementation you want.
Should you select k-means++ implementation you will also have to go to data.cc and follow the guidelines given with comments on the Data::CarefullSeedingKPP(int K) method.
